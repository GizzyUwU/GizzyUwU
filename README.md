<h1 align="center">Hello I'm Nero Gizmo ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p align="center">I was born and raised in Northampton, England.
Since I was in first grade computers have been a huge part of my life.
I was completely fascinated with how they worked.
Since then, I've been learning to program and I now have my own home server where I keep all of my projects.</p>
